4.	A traffic system records the average speed of vehicles every hour for 12 hours.
Write a program that: Reads 12 speed values (floats). Calculates the average speed. Displays whether traffic flow was “Slow” (avg < 40), “Normal” (40–80), or “Fast” (avg > 80).
Concepts: list input, loop, conditional check, average calculation.
